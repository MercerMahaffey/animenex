## About:
**What Anime Should I Watch** helps individuals decide which anime to watch next.

## Walkthrough:
Individuals select a specific **genre** they want to watch, and based on their selection, they will receive several different anime recommendations. 


Each anime recommendation comes in a card that details the title, image, synopsis, and a random quote from the anime. Users can click to flip over the cards to read the synopsis of that anime.


If curious, users can also see our favorite t.v shows and animes on our **About Us** page. Similar to our homepage, the user can select any team member to see our recommended shows.
